# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
This data mining project uses Kaggle's COVID-19 dataset to perform NLP techniques as well as data mining techniques to retreive useful information. The code performs the following:

- Computes the possible sentiments that a tweet may have, the second most popular sentiment in the tweets, and the date with the greatest number of extremely positive tweets. 
- Tokenize the tweets, counts the total number of words, number of distinct words and top 10 most frequent words.
- Plots histograms with word frequencies including words and the fraction of documents in a which a word appears.
- Produces a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for the Coronavirus Tweets NLP data set using scikit-learn.
